# 📘 Sanctions & Banking Exposure: Panel Data Analysis (1993–2023)

This project investigates how Western banks’ cross-border claims on Russian banks were affected by economic sanctions in 2014 and 2022. The analysis combines **panel econometrics (Stata)** and **data visualisation (Python)** based on BIS banking data.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Stata 17**: Panel regression models (FE, RE, PCSE), diagnostic testing (Hausman, Breusch–Pagan, White)
- **Python**: Data visualisation (matplotlib, pandas)
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preparation

---

## 🔍 Methods

- Panel data regression using PCSE (Panel-Corrected Standard Errors)
- Fixed and random effects comparison
- Year/country trend visualisation
- Robustness checks and interaction terms
